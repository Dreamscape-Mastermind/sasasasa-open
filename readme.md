# Private KYC Verification System

A privacy-preserving KYC verification system using Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable identity verification without exposing sensitive user data.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a minimal viable implementation of a privacy-first KYC system where:
1. Users submit ID documents once
2. TEEs securely process and encrypt the documents off-chain
3. ZK proofs verify identity attributes without revealing raw data
4. Smart contracts handle on-chain verification

We might pivot but its where we choose to starting.

## Core Features (1-Week Scope)

- [ ] Basic document upload interface
- [ ] TEE implementation for document processing (using AWS Nitro/Azure Confidential Computing)
- [ ] Simple ZK proof generation for basic identity attributes (age > 18, nationality, etc.)
- [ ] Smart contract for verification
- [ ] Basic web interface for end-to-end demo

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **ZK Framework**: circom/snarkjs
- **TEE Platform**: AWS Nitro Enclaves
- **Backend**: Node.js

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up local environment
4. Run the development server
