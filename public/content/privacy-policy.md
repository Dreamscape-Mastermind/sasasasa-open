## OVERVIEW

This Privacy Policy applies to the Dreamscape Mastermind-owned and operated website ("us," "we," or "our") at [www.sasasasa.co](https://www.sasasasa.co) (the "Site"). Dreamscape Mastermind understands the importance of privacy and the care users expect regarding how their information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as how you can control the collection, correction, and/or deletion of information we receive from users of the Site. We will not use or share your information except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The use of information collected through the Site is limited to the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

Merchants on sasasasa.co may access certain information you provide, such as your name, email address, and phone number. Dreamscape Mastermind does not control how merchants use your information beyond what is stipulated in our terms and conditions. Merchants are prohibited from redistributing your information to any third party not directly authorized by you.

By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

While using the Site, we may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, and email address.

If you choose to purchase a product, ticket, or digital content, we or our third-party payment processors will collect your payment information. We may send you service-related emails regarding your account or purchase; however, we do not send promotional emails. If you no longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt out.

Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include your computer's IP address, browser type, browser version, the pages you visit on our Site, and other statistics.

## 3. COOKIES

Cookies are files with small amounts of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer's hard drive. Like many sites, we use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies, though certain site functionalities may be impacted.

## 4. SECURITY

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no transmission method over the Internet, or electronic storage method, is 100% secure. While we use various security measures to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Dreamscape Mastermind is committed to protecting your privacy and data, but cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to the platform.

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Dreamscape Mastermind does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. Should we discover we have collected such information, we will delete it promptly. If you believe we might have information about a child under 13, please contact us at [admin@sasasasa.co](mailto:admin@sasasasa.co).
